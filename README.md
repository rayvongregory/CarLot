# Car Lot

An app I've been building while on GenSpark Bench. This application allows users to buy and sell used cars.

## Guest Permissions

As a guest, you will be able to search and view cars that are being sold by other users and access the /login and /register pages.

## Guest Restrictions

As a guest, you will not be able to view seller contact information or the asking price any car. You will also not be allowed to sell your car on the app or interact with any other users.

## Registered User Permissions

As a registered user, you will be able to search and view cars that are being sold by other users. Additionally, you will be able to see seller contact information and interact with other registered users. You can also view and edit your account and contact information and request to have your car listed on the app. When your car is listed, you will be able to view the edit history for the listing if you ever want to revert back to a previous post.

## Registered User Restrictions

As a registered user, you will not be able to list your car directly on the app. Instead, you must wait for an administrator to approve your listing before it is viewable to others. If your listing is not approved, the listing will be returned to you to edit or delete. Once your car has been listed, you may delete it without needing approval from an adminstrator, but all edits must be approved by an administrator.

## Administration Permissions

As an adminstrator, you will be able to approve or deny requests to list cars or edit existing listings. If you choose to deny a request, you can provide the user with feedback on how they can improve their listing. If a user's list request or edit request is deemed inappropriate, administrators are allowed to suspend that user's account for up to 30 days.
